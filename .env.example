# Example .env file for claude-diarize
# Copy this file to ".env" and fill in the values.
# The project reads the HuggingFace token from the HF_TOKEN environment
# variable. This token is required for accessing models (e.g. pyannote, Granite).
# Get your token at: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

# Required: HuggingFace token
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here

# Notes:
# - Do NOT commit your real .env file with actual secret tokens to source control.
# - The code supports passing the token via command-line using --token as well.
# - Some models (pyannote/segmentation, pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1)
#   may also require accepting model terms on HuggingFace before use.
# - If you prefer, set the variable in your shell instead:
#     export HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
